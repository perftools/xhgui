# XHGui

A graphical interface for XHProf profiling data that can store the results in MongoDB or PDO database.

Application is [profiled](#profiling-a-web-request-or-cli-script) and the
profiling data is transferred to XHGui, which takes that information, saves it
in MongoDB (or PDO database), and provides a convenient GUI for working with
it.

# System Requirements

XHGui has the following requirements:

- PHP version 7.0 up to 7.3
- [MongoDB Extension][ext-mongodb] MongoDB PHP driver: `pecl install mongodb`
  XHGui requires verison 1.3.0 or later.
  - If using MongoDB storage, see [MongoDB](#MongoDB) requirements
  - If using PDO storage, see [PDO](#PDO) requirements
- To profile an application, one of the profiling PHP extensions is required.
  See [Profiling a Web Request or CLI script](#profiling-a-web-request-or-cli-script).
  The extension is not needed to run XHGui itself.

## MongoDB

The default installation uses MongoDB database. Most of the documentation speaks about MongoDB.

- [MongoDB Extension][ext-mongodb] MongoDB PHP driver: `pecl install mongodb`
  XHGui requires verison 1.3.0 or later.
- [MongoDB][mongodb] MongoDB Itself. XHGui requires version 2.2.0 or later.

[ext-mongodb]: https://pecl.php.net/package/mongodb
[mongodb]: https://www.mongodb.com/

## PDO

- [PDO][ext-pdo] PHP extension

Any of the drivers and an accompanying database:

- [SQLite (PDO)][ext-pdo_sqlite]
- [MySQL (PDO)][ext-pdo_mysql]
- [PostgreSQL (PDO)][ext-pdo_pgsql]

Additionally, to use PDO with XHGui, you must either install the MongoDB PHP extension or skip platform requirements checks via the composer. PDO may not support all the features of XHGui.

[ext-pdo_sqlite]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-sqlite.php

[ext-pdo_pgsql]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-pgsql.php

# Installation from source

1. Clone or download `xhgui` from GitHub.

2. Point your webserver to the `webroot` directory.

3. Set the permissions on the `cache` directory to allow the
   webserver to create files. If you're lazy, `0777` will work.

   The following command changes the permissions for the `cache` directory:

   ```bash
   chmod -R 0777 cache
   ```

4. Start a MongoDB instance. XHGui uses the MongoDB instance to store
   profiling data.

5. If your MongoDB setup uses authentication, or isn't running on the
   default port and localhost, update XHGui's `config/config.php` so that XHGui
   can connect to your `mongod` instance.

6. (**Optional**, but recommended) Add indexes to MongoDB to improve performance.

   XHGui stores profiling information in a `results` collection in the
   `xhprof` database in MongoDB. Adding indexes improves performance,
   letting you navigate pages more quickly.

   To add an index, open a `mongo` shell from your command prompt.
   Then, use MongoDB's `db.collection.ensureIndex()` method to add
   the indexes, as in the following:

   ```
   $ mongo
   > use xhprof
   > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'meta.SERVER.REQUEST_TIME' : -1 } )
   > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'profile.main().wt' : -1 } )
   > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'profile.main().mu' : -1 } )
   > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'profile.main().cpu' : -1 } )
   > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'meta.url' : 1 } )
   > db.results.ensureIndex( { 'meta.simple_url' : 1 } )
   ```

7. Run XHGui's install script. The install script downloads composer and
   uses it to install the XHGui's dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/xhgui
   php install.php
   ```

8. Set up your webserver. The Configuration section below describes how
   to setup the rewrite rules for both nginx and apache.

# Installation with Docker

This setup uses [docker-compose] to orchestrate docker containers.

1. Clone or download `xhgui` from GitHub.

2. Startup the containers: `docker-compose up -d`

3. Open your browser at http://xhgui.127.0.0.1.xip.io:8142 or just http://localhost:8142 or type at terminal `composer open`

4. To customize xhgui, copy `config/config.default.php` to `config/config.php` and edit that file.

5. To customize docker-compose, copy `docker-compose.yml` to `docker-compose.override.yml` and edit that file.

# Configuration

## Configure Webserver Re-Write Rules

XHGui prefers to have URL rewriting enabled, but will work without it.
For Apache, you can do the following to enable URL rewriting:

1. Make sure that an .htaccess override is allowed and that AllowOverride
   has the directive FileInfo set for the correct DocumentRoot.

   Example configuration for Apache 2.4:

   ```apache
   <Directory /var/www/xhgui/>
       Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride FileInfo
       Require all granted
   </Directory>
   ```

2. Make sure you are loading up mod_rewrite correctly.
   You should see something like:

   ```apache
   LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so
   ```

3. XHGui comes with a `.htaccess` file to enable the remaining rewrite rules.

For nginx and fast-cgi, you can use the following snippet as a start:

```nginx
server {
    listen   80;
    server_name example.com;

    # root directive should be global
    root   /var/www/example.com/public/xhgui/webroot/;
    index  index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_pass    127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_index   index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}
```

# Profiling a Web Request or CLI script

The recommended way tho profile an application is to use [perftools/php-profiler] package.

You can use that package to collect data from your web applications and CLI
scripts.

This data is then pushed into XHGui database where it can be viewed with this
application.

It offers submitting data directly to XHGui instance once the profiling is
complete at the end of the request.

If the site cannot directly connect to XHGui instance, the package offers
solution to capture profiling data to file which you can import using
`external/import.php` script:

```bash
php external/import.php -f /path/to/jsonlinesfile.jsonl
```

**Warning**: Importing the same file twice will create duplicate profiles.

## Limiting MongoDB Disk Usage

Disk usage can grow quickly, especially when profiling applications with large
code bases or that use larger frameworks.

To keep the growth
in check, configure MongoDB to automatically delete profiling documents once they
have reached a certain age by creating a [TTL index](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/index-ttl/).

Decide on a maximum profile document age in seconds: you
may wish to choose a lower value in development (where you profile everything),
than production (where you profile only a selection of documents). The
following command instructs Mongo to delete documents over 5 days (432000
seconds) old.

```
$ mongo
> use xhprof
> db.results.ensureIndex( { "meta.request_ts" : 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds : 432000 } )
```

## Waterfall Display

The goal of XHGui's waterfall display is to recognize that concurrent requests can
affect each other. Concurrent database requests, CPU-intensive
activities and even locks on session files can become relevant. With an
Ajax-heavy application, understanding the page build is far more complex than
a single load: hopefully the waterfall can help. Remember, if you're only
profiling a sample of requests, the waterfall fills you with impolite lies.

Some Notes:

- There should probably be more indexes on MongoDB for this to be performant.
- The waterfall display introduces storage of a new `request_ts_micro` value, as second level
  granularity doesn't work well with waterfalls.
- The waterfall display is still very much in alpha.
- Feedback and pull requests are welcome :)

# Monitoring

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics suitable for monitoring service
health are exposed on `/metrics`.  (This currently only works if using PDO for
storage.)
